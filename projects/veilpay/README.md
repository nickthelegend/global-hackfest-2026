## Overview

VeilPay solves the problem of total transparency on public blockchains by providing a production-grade privacy layer for Conflux eSpace. It enables users to make stealth payments (EIP-5564) and trade on a ZK-SNARKs powered Dark Pool, keeping their financial activities shielded from public tracking. The core innovation is a "Round-Up" micro-investment engine that automatically shields and invests spare change into yield-bearing privacy vaults.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

**What problem does your project solve?**

Public blockchains like Conflux are transparent by design, which means every payment, trade, and investment is linked to a permanent public identity. This leads to:
- **Privacy Risks**: Personal spending habits are exposed to anyone with an explorer.
- **Security Risks**: Large holders are easily targeted through wallet tracking.
- **Lack of Institutional Adoption**: Businesses cannot use public DeFi for confidential payroll or trading without exposing sensitive data.

## 💡 Solution

**How does your project address the problem?**

VeilPay provides a multi-layer privacy model:
1.  **Stealth Payments (EIP-5564)**: Every peer-to-peer payment uses a unique, one-time address derived from the recipient's public "meta-address".
2.  **ZK Dark Pool**: Shielded trading where order details (price/amount) are never revealed on-chain. Noir ZK-SNARKs prove trade validity without exposing inputs.
3.  **Privacy Vaults**: Assets are deposited into a shielded vault to break the link between public identities and trading activity.
4.  **AI Privacy Diagnostic**: An integrated agent that analyzes transaction patterns and provides an "Anonymity Score" to help users avoid doxxing their wallets.

## Go-to-Market Plan (required)

- **Target Audience**: Privacy-conscious retail users, micro-investors, and developers looking for private P2P payment rails.
- **Adoption Strategy**: Leveraging the "Round-Up" feature to lower the barrier to entry for privacy—users don't have to learn complex ZK tools; they just spend as usual, and VeilPay handles the shielding.
- **Ecosystem Fit**: VeilPay acts as a fundamental privacy primitive for the Conflux ecosystem, enabling confidential financial operations for other dApps.

## ⚡ Conflux Integration

**How does your project leverage Conflux features?**

- [x] **eSpace**: Core protocol and contracts deployed on eSpace Testnet (Chain ID 71).
- [x] **Gas Sponsorship**: All vault deposits and stealth announcements are gasless for the user via Conflux Fee Sponsorship.
- [x] **cfxdevkit**: Uses `@cfxdevkit/node` for chain utilities and follows the **AIflux** agent pattern.

### Partner Integrations

- [x] **Noir**: Used for ZK-SNARKs circuits and order commitments.
- [x] **Convex**: Used for sub-second indexing of stealth announcements.

## ✨ Features
